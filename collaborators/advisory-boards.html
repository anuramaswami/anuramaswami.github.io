<h2>Professional Societies and Advisory Boards</h2>

<section id="about" class="my-4">
  <p>I enjoy interdisciplinary collaborations fostered at the International Society for Industrial Ecology, where I’ve
    served on the board and in particular, I've served on the Sustainable Urban Systems section of the ISIE.</p>
  <p>The International Society for Industrial Ecology promotes industrial ecology as a way of finding innovative
    solutions to complicated environmental problems, and facilitates communication among scientists, engineers,
    policymakers, managers and advocates who are interested in better integrating environmental concerns with economic
    activities. <a href="https://is4ie.org">Learn more about ISIE.</a></p>

          <p>In this project by the US National Science Foundation Sustainability Research Network Program, Ramaswami
            leads a network of 24 faculty who are exploring the question of developing healthy and livable cities
            through an interdisciplinary focus on physical infrastructure by incorporating infrastructure design, public
            attitude, and policy design.</p>
          <p>The focus of this network is specifically on exploring if, when, and how distributed infrastructure
            contributes to advancing sustainability, health, and well-being in cities.</p>
          <p>This network is a collaboration of 8 US Universities, Universities in India, and cities and industries
            collaborating together.</p>

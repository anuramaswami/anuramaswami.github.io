<h2>International Projects</h2>

<section id="about" class="my-4">
  <p>All my US projects have strong international components. In addition, I also serve on the United Nation's
    International Resources Panel <b>(add link)</b>. The Panel’s mission is to provide independent, coherent and
    authoritative
    scientific assessments of policy relevance on the sustainable use of natural resources and, in particular, their
    environmental impacts over the full life cycle; and contribute to a better understanding of how to decouple economic
    growth from environmental degradation. Specifically, I've been active on three projects. (UN IRP logo on right of

            This
            report presents the current outlook and future trajectories for global resource use with implications for
            sustainable development. Ramaswami’s team leads chapters on cities and air pollution, identifying strategies
            at
            the intersection of infrastructure planning and resource efficiency that can reduce air pollution and
            advance
            sustainable development in cities of both developed and developing nations. This report was launched at the
            United Nations Third Environmental Assembly in Nairobi in 2017. (photo of Anu with three colleagues at

          <p>This report contextualizes the Weight of Cities report to urbanization in the Association for Southeast
            Asian
            Nations. The ASEAN Nations are a block of 10 countries including: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,
            Singapore, Philippines, Myanmar, Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos. A key finding in this report is that the region
            is
            expecting the rise of more than 200 small cities over next 30 years, making infrastructure planning very
            important for sustainability. Strategies are identified in land use planning, transportation planning,
            energy
            efficient buildings, and cross sector ways to value projects to enhance resource efficiency while developing
            inclusive cities. (some pic or front page of report)</p>

          <p>The Weight of Cities report makes a first order estimation of the material requirements for key
            infrastructure
            sectors in cities including buildings and transportation networks. My group contributes by accessing the
            material requirements to develop more equitable and inclusive, resource efficient cities in India. (Ajay any

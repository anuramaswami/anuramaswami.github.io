<h2>City Projects</h2>

<section id="about" class="my-4">
  <p>Ramaswami's team has worked with several cities on individual projects where we support cities in taking an inventory of
    their energy use and carbon emissions and strategizing pathways toward future sustainable
    infrastructure planning. We are working with cities in Colorado (Denver, Bloomfield, Arvada, and others), as well as
    cities and counties in the Midwestern US, including in Dane County, WI.</p>

  <p>In Minnesota, our group has collaborated with partners including LHB, GPI and the Energy Transitions Lab to 
    co-develop a tool that would help cities in identifying high
    impact and cost-effective pathways towards low carbon and sustainable infrastructures.</p>

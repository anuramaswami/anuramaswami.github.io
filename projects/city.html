<h2>City Projects</h2>

<section id="about" class="my-4">
  <p>Our team has worked with several cities on individual projects where we support cities in taking an inventory of
    their energy use and GHG emissions of carbon footprints and charting a path forward for the sustainable
    infrastructure future planning. We work with cities in Colorado (Denver, Bloomfield, Arvada, and others), as well as
    cities and counties in the midwest, including in Dane County, WI.</p>

  <p>In the Minneapolis Area, we work on a project called LOGOPEP. Our group has collaborated with several local state
    quotas including LHB and the Energy Transitions Lab to co-develop a tool that would help cities in identifying high
    impact and cost-effective pathways towards low carbon and sustainable infrastructures. <a
